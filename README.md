<h2 align="left">About 42 Network</h2>

###

<p align="left">The 42 network is a global network of coding and programming schools that offer tuition-free, project-based learning in computer programming and software development. The network was originally founded in France by Xavier Niel and has since expanded to include campuses in various countries around the world. The name "42" is a reference to the science fiction novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, in which the number 42 is famously described as the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."<br><br>The 42 network is known for its innovative and rigorous approach to education, where students learn through practical, hands-on projects and problem-solving rather than traditional classroom instruction. It is open to people of all backgrounds and does not charge tuition fees, making it accessible to a wide range of learners interested in developing their coding and programming skills.</p>
